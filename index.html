<h1>Happy Birthday Urvi ❤️</h1>

<div class="message">

Urvi,

There are so many things I should have said long ago.

There were moments when you were tired… when you felt unheard… when loving me was not easy.  
There were days when I was immature, toxic, angry, stubborn.. when my ego was louder than my love.

And yet… you stayed.

You stayed when you could have left.  
You stayed when I didn’t deserve it.  
You stayed when loving me required strength I didn’t even see in you at the time.

Those first two years… I know I wasn’t the man you needed.  
I made mistakes. I hurt you. I failed you in ways I can never undo.  
But instead of walking away, you chose to believe in a better version of me.

You saw something in me that I didn’t even see in myself.

You didn’t just love me...you built me.  
You corrected me.  
You humbled me.  
You taught me patience.  
You taught me what real love looks like.

Because of you, I am a better man today.  
A better human.  
A better partner.

You didn’t give up on me.  
You gave me a chance.

And I promise you, that chance was never wasted.

Every time you almost left but stayed… you saved us.  
You saved me.

I don’t say this enough... but I owe my growth to you.

On your birthday, I don’t just celebrate the girl I love.  
I celebrate the woman who made me who I am.

Thank you for choosing me even when it was hard.  
Thank you for loving me even when I was difficult.  
Thank you for believing in us when I didn’t know how.

You are my calm.  
My safe place.  
My home.

And in every universe… I would still choose you.

Thank you for being the perfect Gwen to your Spiderman.

Forever yours.
