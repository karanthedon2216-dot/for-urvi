  <h2>To My Urvi ❤️</h2>
  <p>

There were so many times you could have walked away…  
So many moments when I made it difficult to stay.  

In those first two years… I was immature. I was reactive. I let ego speak louder than love. I let anger speak louder than understanding. I hurt you without realizing how deeply words can cut. And yet… you stayed.

You stayed when leaving would have been easier.  
You stayed when I was toxic, when I was stubborn, when I didn’t know how to love properly.  

And instead of giving up on me… you believed in the version of me I hadn’t even become yet.

You didn’t just love me.  
You changed me.

You taught me patience.  
You taught me softness.  
You taught me that love isn’t about winning arguments — it’s about protecting each other’s hearts.

Every time you were about to leave but didn’t…  
every time you chose us over your pain…  
every time you gave me another chance when I barely deserved the first…

you were building the man I am today.

If I am calmer now… it’s because of you.  
If I think before I speak… it’s because of you.  
If I love deeper… it’s because you showed me how.

You didn’t just become my girlfriend.  
You became my growth. My lesson. My mirror. My peace.

And if I am your Spider-Man…  
thank you for being the perfect Gwen —  
the one who stays, who believes, who saves me in ways I never even realized I needed saving.

I love you.  
Not just for who you are.  
But for who you helped me become.

Forever yours.
