Urvi,

There are so many things I should have said long ago...

There were moments when loving me was not easy.
There were times when I was immature, toxic, stubborn, and blinded by my own ego.

But you stayed.

You stayed when you could have walked away.
You stayed when I didn’t deserve your patience.
You stayed when loving me required strength I didn’t even see.

Those first two years…
I was not the man you needed.
But instead of giving up, you believed in who I could become.

You didn’t just love me.
You transformed me.

Because of you, I learned how to love properly.
Because of you, I learned humility.
Because of you, I became a better man.

Every time you almost left but chose to stay...
you saved us.

You are my safe place.
My calm.
My home.

And in every lifetime…
I would still choose you.

Thank you for being the perfect Gwen to your Spiderman.
